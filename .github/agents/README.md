# Agent Instructions Directory

This directory contains comprehensive instructions for AI agents working on the azure-pipelines-tasks-terraform repository.

## Files in This Directory

- **instructions.md**: Comprehensive guide for AI agents working on this repository
- **README.md**: This file

## Agent Instructions

The `instructions.md` file provides detailed information about:

- Repository structure and organization
- Build, test, and development workflows
- Code patterns and conventions
- Common development tasks
- Troubleshooting guides
- CI/CD pipeline details
- How to use context7 MCP server for documentation queries

**AI agents should read this file first** when working on this repository to understand the codebase and development practices.

## Using context7 MCP Server

AI agents should use the **context7** MCP server to efficiently query documentation and understand the codebase. This is especially useful for:

- Querying Terraform documentation
- Looking up Azure DevOps task SDK documentation  
- Understanding Azure Pipelines concepts
- Searching for TypeScript/Node.js best practices
- Finding Cucumber testing documentation

### Example Queries

When working on this repository, use context7 to:

1. **Understand Terraform commands**: Query Terraform CLI documentation for command syntax and options
2. **Azure DevOps Task development**: Look up task SDK methods and patterns
3. **Testing patterns**: Search Cucumber BDD documentation for testing best practices
4. **TypeScript conventions**: Find type definitions and patterns

## Benefits for AI Agents

Using these resources provides several benefits:

1. **Faster Onboarding**: Comprehensive instructions reduce time spent exploring
2. **Consistency**: Standardized workflows and patterns across sessions
3. **Better Documentation Access**: Use context7 to query official documentation efficiently
4. **Context**: Stored memories and documentation preserve institutional knowledge
5. **Efficiency**: Pre-documented patterns reduce repetitive exploration

## Maintenance

When updating this repository:

1. **Update instructions.md** if you:
   - Change build/test workflows
   - Add new coding conventions
   - Modify repository structure
   - Discover important patterns
   - Find useful context7 queries or documentation resources

2. **Update memories** using the `store_memory` tool when you:
   - Discover new facts about the codebase
   - Learn about conventions not documented elsewhere
   - Fix issues that might recur
